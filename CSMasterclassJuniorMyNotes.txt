_CIL()
*****************
CommonIntermediateLanguage

Intermediate Language Disassembler 
Ildasm.exe - installed with .NET 
bin/CommonIntermediateLanguage.dll 
JIT compiler - feature of CLR 
CIL - is platform independent 
1 stage compiler (->CIL) also prepares metadata (type list, etc)

*****************
_CLR()
*****************
Common Language Runtime - environment that manages execution of .NET apps 
- works as a special OS for .NET apps 
- it's a critical component - manages basically everything under the hood 
- OS-CLR-app 
it manages: 
- JIT 
- exception handling
- memory
- thread 
- type safety and CTS 

CTS - Common Type System - standardized type system for all .NET languages (so they can be compiled to CIL)
CLR is an implementation of CLI - Common Language Infrastructure (ISO standardized blueprint)
e.g. Mono Runtime - another implementation of CLI 
- any custom implementation can be created 

*****************
_CSvsNET()
*****************
99% of C# apps run on .NET 
.NET provides CLR
.NET provides set of standard libs
System.String
System.Math
System.Console
System.Collections
System.Random
System.Exception 

2002 .NET Framwork  
2016 .NET Core

*****************
_ValuevsReferenceTypes() - important topic! 
*****************
ValueTypesAndReferenceTypes - look at it! 

* VALUE types (int, bool, struct)
- inherit from System.ValueType
- passed by copy
- on assigment: value is copied
- stored on stack
- sealed - so method/class cannot inherit form it 

* REFERENCE types (array, list, string, object, classes)
- inherit from System.Object 
- passed by reference 
- on assignment - reference is copied 
- stored on heap

*****************
_BoxingUnboxing()
*****************
BoxingAndUnboxing

Boxing - wrapping a value type into an instance of a type System.Object (reference type)
Unboxing - converting boxed value back to a value type 

string word = "abc"; - stack: address to "abc" & heap: value "abc"
int number = 5; //stack
object boxedNumber = number; //stack: address of boxedNumber, heap: value of number
int unboxedNumber = (int)boxedNumber;

object boxedNumber = number; //boxing is implicit 
int unboxedNumber = (int)boxedNumber; //BoxingAndUnboxing is explicit

what's boxing for?? 
- to provied a unified type system - which assumes every variable is an object
- it was very useful before generics were invented 
- those times ArrayList were popular 
- boxing is no

ADO.NET uses boxing - every object in a database is an instance of System.Object

both expensive:
boxing - assignment to object 
unboxing - casting 

*****************
_ThreeMainTypesOfErrors()
*****************
TypesOfErrors

1. compilation errors (syntax errors, without pressing run button)
2. runtime errors (thrown during execution (also through VS run button), crash here)
3. logical errors (when program produces wrong result without crashing)
- to detect logical errors it's best to use suite of unit tests 

Unit tests protect us from runtime AND logical errors!
mechanism of Exceptions protects us from runtime errors!

*****************
_Exceptions()
*****************
ExceptionsHandling

How do we handle the errors -> Try-Catch_Finally blocks:
Try - the code may thrown exception
Catch - what should be done if error 
Finally - executed no matter if exception was thrown or not 
- Finally is typically used to free-up the resources (e.g. connection to db)

e.g. 
system error -> OutOfMemoryException
numeric error -> OverflowException (int no large)
parsing error -> FormatException (wrong casting)
operation errors -> ArgumentOutOfRangeException (removing first element when NULL)

all exceptions derive from System.Exception 

What will be printed? ("Uno, Due, Tre, Quattro")
try 
{
	Console.WriteLine("Uno");
	throw new ArgumentException(); //this directs to catch because it's a subtype of Execution which is used in catch block below
}
catch(Exception ex)
{
	Console.WriteLine("Due");
}
Finally 
{
	Console.WriteLine("Tre")
}
Console.WriteLine("Quattro") //this will be printed as the exception in catch block is handled 

try 
{
	Console.WriteLine("Uno");
	throw new Exception(); //This won't go to catch block
}
catch(ArgumentException ex) //we handle only a specific subtype od Exception
{
	Console.WriteLine("Due");
}
Finally 
{
	Console.WriteLine("Tre")
}
Console.WriteLine("Quattro")

//This will crash!


*****************
_AccessModfiers() - important
*****************
AccessModifiers & AccessModifiersOtherAssembly

public class TestClass
{
	public string PublicField = "public"; //accessible in any class in any assembly
	internal string InternalField = "internal"; //accessible in any class in this assembly
	protected string ProtectedField = "protected"; // accessible only in classes derived from this class
	protected internal string ProtectedInternalField = "protected internal"; // accessible from any class in this assembly, OR from derived classes in other assemblies
	private protected string PrivateProtectedField = "private protected"; // in this assembly can only be accessed from classes derived from this class. Not accessible in another assemblies at all.
	private string PrivateField = "private"; // not accessible in any other class
}

used in classes, structs, records 
BUT: structs do not ingerit (only private, internal, private in use)!

Assembly - compiled output of the code, typically *.dll
a sibgle project in VS defines a single assembly 

*****************
_DefaultAccessModifiers()
*****************
DefaultAccessModifiers

by default: the most restrictive in the given context: 

two levels where we can use access modifiers:
1. namespace level (class, struct, record, enum, delegate, interface)
2. class level (field, property, method, event, nested classes(class, struct, record, enum, delegate, interface))

1. namespace level: default INTERNAL (we cannot create private class at this level!!)
2. class level: default PRIVATE 

NOTE: nested classes: default PRIVATE !!! (as thay are at class level)

*****************
_SealedModifier()
*****************
SealedModifier

sealed modifier: 
1. prevents a class from being inherited 
2. prevents overriden method from further overriding 

sealed class used when: 
- there is no point in deriving from this class 
- sth strange may happen when overriding the method
- for security reasons 
- speeds up CLR (it doesn't need to look for any overriding classes further)

drawbacks:
- developer cannot implement his own behaviour because of sealing 
- it makes unit tests super difficult 

NOTE: only overriden methods can be sealed! 
NOTE: abstract class cannot be sealed! (it's created to be inherited from)
NOTE: static class is implicitly sealed (we cannot seal it explicitly)

*****************
_Params()
*****************
Params

param - allows to pass any number of params of the same type to a method 

NOTE: params keyword can only be applied to the last parameter 
NOTE: params keyword must be used with single-dimensional array

*****************
_ClassVsStruct()
*****************
ClassVsStruct

STRUCT 
- are value types (stored on stack, passed by copy, inherit from System.ValueType)
-- are sealed (cannot be inherited!) (as all value types are!)
- ctor with parametes only 
- all ctor fields must be assigned 
- cannot have explicit parameterless ctor 
- cannot have destructors (finalizers)

CLASS 
- reference types 

NOTE: destructor - special method that is executed when the object is being removed from the memory 
NOTE: all value types are implicitly sealed!
NOTE: immutable type - once created cannot be modified 

when should be use struct?? 
- the type is logically small 
- type is small from memory point of view 
- the type is immutable 
- type is commonly short-lived 
- we want value type semantics 
- it won't be boxed frequently! 

what is the base type for structs? - System.ValueType

*****************
_PartialClasses()
*****************
PartialClasses

- classes that split over two/MORE source files 
- all parts are combined at compilation 
- also: partial structs, interfaces, methods 

//two partial classes - are equivalent to a one 
partial class Duck
{
    private void Quack()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Quack, quack, I'm a duck");
    }
}
partial class Duck
{
    public void Fly()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Flying high in the sky");
    }
}

partial methods are slightly different to partial classes:
- method signature and method body are defined in a separate files  

NOTE:
- partial classes are not commonly used!
- used when class body is large 
- when many developers works together on the same class (this avoids mergin errors)
- used in automatic code generation situations (to avoid conlifcts with human-written code) 
-- e.g. in Windows Forms - some code is generated automatically 
-- e.g. used in Entity Framework 

*****************
_NewKeyword() - difficult one!
*****************
1. new operator (new instance of a type)
2. new modifier (to hide member from a base class in a derived class)
3. new constraint (specifies that the type argument in a generic class must have a parameterless ctor)

1.
var rachel = new Person("Rachel", 34); //constructor call
Person john = new("John", 19); //C# 9 style
var steve = new Person { Name = "Steve", Age = 45 }; //object initialization
var currencies = new Dictionary<string, string> //collection initialization
{
    ["USA"] = "USD",
    ["Great Britain"] = "GBP"
};

var numbers = new int[4]; //array creation
var person = new { Name = "Anna", Age = 55 }; //anonymous type

2. see: rozdzial 35 "method overriding"

3. 
class MyGeneric<T> where T: new() //this is constraint - we ensure by so that any type we use as T will have a parameterless ctor
{
	private T t;
	public void Init()
	{
		t = new T(); //object of type T creation 
	}
}

<List<int>>() - list has a parameterless ctor!

how can I create a new object of type T in a generic class?
- by using new constraint: where T: new()

*****************
_StaticKeyword()
*****************
StaticKeyword

static keyword is used in two conexts:
1. static modifier 
2. using static directive 

1. can be used with: classes, members, properties, ctors, evetns, operators, local functions, lambda expressions, anonymous methods 
cannot be used with: structs, records 

** static members belong to a type itself ** - not to a specific instance 

2. to avoid repeating the code 
using static System.Math;

e.g. how to shorten Console.WriteLine(); ??
using static System.Console  :)

NOTE: const is implicitly static (acessible by type)
NOTE: static field can be nicely used to track counter incremented by different isntances of s class 

*****************
_StaticClass()
*****************
StaticClass

- cannot be instantiated 
- can contain only static methods 
- they are sealed (cannot be inherited)
- cannot have instance ctor 
- can have static ctor! 
- cannot use "this" keyword (it points at current instance)

- works as container for methods that only operates on input parameters and do not change any internal instance fields 

build-in static classes: 
- System.Console 
- System.Math 
- System.Environment

static ctor - it's called when static class is used for the 1st time! 
- must be parameterless (used only to initialize static fields)

Is it possible to have a static ctor in non-static class?? 
YES! non-static classes can have static fields and these fields can be initialized in a static ctor 
- static ctor will be called BEFORE an instance ctor!
